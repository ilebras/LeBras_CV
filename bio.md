Isabela Le Bras is a sea-going physical oceanographer interested in the ocean's large-scale circulation. Her research is motivated by a desire to understand the ocean's role in the climate system. To date, her work has focused on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), an intricate system of currents that stabilizes the earthâ€™s climate by redistributing heat, salt, oxygen, and carbon on a global scale. More recently, she has examined the circulation in high-latitude regions undergoing rapid change.

Le Bras received a B.A. in physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 2010 and a Ph.D. in physical oceanography from the Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology-Woods  Hole  Oceanographic  Institution (MIT-WHOI) Joint Program in 2017. She joined the scientific staff in May of 2020 after a post-doctoral position at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
