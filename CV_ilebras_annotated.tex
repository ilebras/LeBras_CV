%%% ------------------------------------------------------------
\NewPart{Research Interests}{}
% I am a seagoing physical oceanographer aiming to improve fundamental understanding of observable ocean processes and how they project onto the large scale circulation. 
I am an observational physical oceanographer studying the large scale ocean circulation. My recent research focus has been on better understanding how deep waters are formed and spread into the deep North Atlantic, and how Arctic freshwater impacts the Atlantic's overturning circulation.
